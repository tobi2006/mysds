Resit only offered if student failed module overall / gets less than 35 in one component / QLD component failed?

Only resit failed component
component failed with 35 is fine
consequence for 35 in overall module means student can't progress to next year
no resit if module passed and no qld

Exact consequence resit? Module cap?

yes, except for qld modules
original mark stays, no new average

Sit = average mark from best marks? What if sit worse than initial mark?

highest marks determine the average, students cannot do worse

What happens if student has a sit in one part and resit in another? Module cap?

first sit, see module mark

sit doesn't count for 3 attempts

if students failed 80 or more, suggestion to repeat the year 100 credits fail quite clear. But PD decides

Do I understand it right that there are only three attempts for QLD, also if year retaken? 2 attempts per year for non-QLD purpose? Concessions possible?

Do we need to know anything about external modules except credits and overall mark?
assessment components as well
