Resit only offered if student failed module overall / gets less than 35 in one component / QLD component failed?

Exact consequence resit? Module cap?

Sit = average mark from best marks? What if sit worse than initial mark?

What happens if student has a sit in one part and resit in another? Module cap?

Third attempt for QLD modules and students only? Consequence? Module cap etc?

Do I understand it right that there are only three attempts for QLD, also if year retaken? 2 attempts per year for non-QLD purpose? Concessions possible?

Failed year = clean slate for year except for QLD attempts?

Do we need to know anything about external modules except credits and overall mark?

Things to change in Handbook:
+ my name
+ Appendices (old cover sheet, "Law and Politics of the EU"
